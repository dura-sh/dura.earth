## Distributed Ledger Technology

Distributed Ledger Technology (DLT) is a consensus based replication of digital data spread across multiple devices. These devices can be owned by any person or institution so long as they have an access point to the network. There is no one central point of control over the data and in- order to assure data is accurate both a peer-to-peer network and a consensus algorithm are neces- sary.

## Misconceptions

Usually people think of DLT and immediately think of blockchains, which points them into the direction of financial transactions. That, or they think of the irrational marketplace of cryptocur- rency trading. However, this limits the true scope of DLT. To be clear, all that is being transacted in a DLT is data, that means that any can of data storage can theoretically be reimagined to use DLT technologies. It is a misconception that DLT is an all or nothing software model. While there are many theories on how to do so that can potentially create unprecedented changed in the industry, there are also far more practical, stepping-stone like cases for implementation that can be done so more more quickly and are feasible with relative ease. This is also a large misconcep- tion in the industry, that there needs to be a radical redesign in patient data handling. It is true that the current models are ineffective, however, we must be aware of what our users are able to adapt to the best, are willing to use, and ultimately can show signs of practical implementation.
