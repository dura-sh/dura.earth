## Electronic Healthcare Records
EHR or electronic health record are digital records of health information. They contain all the information you’d find in a paper chart and a lot more. EHRs include past medical history, vital signs, progress notes, diagnoses, medications, immunization dates, allergies, lab data and imaging reports. They can also contain other relevant information, such as insurance information, demographic data, and even data imported from personal wellness devices.

## Electronic Medical Records
The EMR or electronic medical record refers to everything you’d find in a paper chart, such as medical history, diagnosis, medications, immunization dates, allergies. While EMRs work well within a practice, they’re limited because they don’t easily travel outside the practice. In fact, the patient’s medical record might even have to be printed out and mailed for another provider to see it.

## Dura Model
The EHR is an evolution of the EMR, however, despite it’s positive direction, it is still limited in the way they are being handled and implemented. A less centralized collection of this data and a ledger of activity can be achieved by decentralizing the data amongst those who access the data about the patient. The Dura model will be approaching healthcare as if each patient is in their own room, just like a hospital visit in real life. The EHR in nature is not what we intend to change. We do believe that an EHR for a patient is a critical shift to better patient care. However, what we insist is that the data be stored in a more suitable fashion that is less about the data being worth monetary value. To do this, we must consider the patient the most important, invaluable piece of data, and as such, no one entity can “own” the data about them. However, through permission based inviting, multiple entities from separate organizations may update patient records and be aware of updates made by others. Being aware of what is being updated about a patient will be known as Electronic Healthcare Events.

## Electronic Healthcare Events
An Electronic Healthcare Event (EHE) is an update to a patient’s EHR ledger. An EHE is sent to a Patient Room and once confirmed, the EHE is made visible on the patient’s ledger and an up- date is made to their EHR reflecting the event.
Utilizing the technology advancements that Matrix has made with Event based data storage, we will decentralized not only the records of the patient but as well as the conversations about the patient. This will allow for a never before look and understanding of patient forward delivery of DME that will save time and provide a more streamlined approach to putting the equipment at the patients door. Additionally, it allows for scalability of the software beyond the DME industry in further implementations.

## Benefits of Event Based Distribution
In an event based distribution model we can interact in real time without a central authority controlling the data being posted, but a collective understanding of the functionality of the space we locate ourselves in. In our case, we are focused on providing the data of a user. Currently, many in the industry are worried only about dynamic content posting, live interaction so to speak. However, Healthcare is a great example of where static content posting is still alive and well. In this sense, what our system allows for is a dynamic understanding of the change happening to static content. While certain variables about a patient may technically be static, such as their name, by making these things events we can track who updates what details about patients and thusly use this data about who is active inside of the room as a method of understanding the patient care process better.
